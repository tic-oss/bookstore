Hello <%= authorName %>,

Ensure that you have all the dependencies required to run a MEAN stack application.

To launch the application, navigate to the "bookshop" folder, which contains the Angular frontend. Open a command prompt and execute the command *npm install*.

Next, proceed to the "rest-api" folder, representing the backend. Run the command *npm install express and npm install -g migrate-mongo* in the command prompt. Once completed, your MEAN stack application will be ready for use.

Component details:

- Keycloak as Identity Management 

To run front-end *ng serve*.

To run backend *node index.js* or if you have nodemon then *nodemon index.js*.
